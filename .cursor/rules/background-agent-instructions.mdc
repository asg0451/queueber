# background agent instructions
(ignore this if you arent a background agent)
## setup
- always install rust nightly via rustup
- also install capnpc (`apt-get install capnproto`) and any other build deps. you CAN install packages

## rules
- never, EVER submit a pr that doesnt build. `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and ci must all pass before you declare success
